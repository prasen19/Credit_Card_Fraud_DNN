# Fraudulent Credit Card Transaction Detection using DNN


1. Credit card companies must be able to recognize fraudulent credit card transactions in order to provide safe banking to their customers.

2. A Convolutional Neural Network is designed with Keras in Tensorflow 2 to predict whether the transaction made by the customer is fraudulent or not.

3. The Dataset is highly imbalanced. So we must achieve high recall such that we should not miss any fraud transaction. 

3. This was one of the Kaggle competition and the dataset was made available on Kaggle.

4. The Results are Recall: 0.80, Precision: 0.79, AUC: 0.92
